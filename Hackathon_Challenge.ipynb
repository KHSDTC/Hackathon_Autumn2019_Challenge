    "\n",
    "We will be working with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which contains 569 samples of __malignent__ and __benign__ tumor cells. The first two columns in the data set store unique ID numbers of the samples and the corresponding real-value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei, which can be used to build a model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. \n",
